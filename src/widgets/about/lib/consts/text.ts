export const Description = `Hi! :) I am a frontend, and if I may say so, almost full-stack developer from Ukraine. You can see more details about my skills in the skills section.

After many years (3.5 years) of labor working and studying, I have developed a strong base in programming, in front-end and back-end areas. 

My main knowledge is in the front-end area, but in the back-end component (node.js environment) I also feel confident!

I have studied a lot of technologies to develop high-quality, scalable applications.
I also did not forget about code quality, wrote a lot, studied different patterns and architectures. Because good, clean and quality code, in my opinion, is one of the most important parts of creating an application, I would say, at the level of architecture.

I am a quick learner, able to work in a team and accomplish tasks alone.

Let's work together and create a product that won't be embarrassing and convenient to use! :)`;
